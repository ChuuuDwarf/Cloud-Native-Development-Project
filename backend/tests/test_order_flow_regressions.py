"""Regression tests for the end-to-end order-flow bugs surfaced 2026-05-29.

Four independent bugs walked through together — each test pins one of them.

1. ``Wip.completed_at`` was NULL after ``confirm_result`` flipped status to
   ``completed``. The dashboard's "完工 today" KPI and every other rolling-24h
   window that filters on ``Wip.completed_at`` silently dropped the row, even
   though ``Wip.status == 'completed'``. The fix stamps ``completed_at`` in
   the service at the same call site that calls ``_set_status(..., COMPLETED)``.

2. The dashboard's ``awaiting_handoff`` / ``done`` pipeline buckets required
   ``Report.status == '已回傳'``. A completed WIP whose report hadn't been
   published yet matched neither bucket and disappeared from the pipeline
   visualisation entirely. The fix drops the report-status condition: bucket
   transitions are now driven purely by ``OrderModel.status``.

3. ``ClosureService.close_order`` raised on "尚有樣品未取件" only when storage
   items existed AND not all were ``picked_up``. An order at ``waiting_pickup``
   with zero storage rows (no inbound has run) bypassed the guard and could
   be flipped to CLOSED before the user had actually picked anything up. The
   fix treats an empty ``items`` list as "not yet picked up" too.

4. ``DashboardRepository.recent_escalations`` filtered ``Issue.status ==
   'escalated'``. Phase K C5 (ack from notification center) flips the issue's
   status to ``acknowledged`` while leaving ``escalation_level > 0`` — so an
   ack'd issue silently disappeared from the supervisor's "Recent Escalations"
   panel the moment they read it. The fix drops the status filter and gates
   on ``escalation_level > 0`` instead so the panel works as a 24h escalation
   audit log, not a "currently-escalating" snapshot.
